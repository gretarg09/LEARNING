All that is required is averaging over the posterior desity for ´p´, while 
computing the predictions. For each possile value of the parameter `p`, there is an 
implied distribution of outcomes.So if you where to compute the sampling ditribution of 
outcomes at each value of p, then you could average all of these predictions distribution 
together, usin gth eposterior probabilities of each value of p, to get a posterior 
predictive distribution.
