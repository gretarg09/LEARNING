\section{Bayesian Marketing Mix Model}

Bayesian mmm have several advantages over traditional
regression models. 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Ability to set constrains on models parameters using priors. 
        e.g. ensure that marketing activity coefficients are non-negative.
    \item Ability to incorporate existing knowledge about the effect of 
        advertising. Parameters can be tuned to external benchmarks from A/B
        or lift tests.
    \item Ability to learn saturation and decay parameters as part of the 
        model fitting process: estimate uncertainty in functions.
        Typically would require iterative optimization and manual tuning.
    \item Produce a generative model that is well-suited simulation.
\end{itemize}
