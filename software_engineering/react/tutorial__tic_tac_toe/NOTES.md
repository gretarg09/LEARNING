# Tic Tac Toe

The tutorial can be found [here](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)


## troubleshooting

The code from the tutorial did not work so I used the following command 
instead to create the project
```
npx create-react-app tutorial__tic_tac_toe
```

I have not idea what this is but it worked.
